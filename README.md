### Hi there 👋, I'm Oscar Pérez-Lora 👨🏻‍💻

Data Scientist 📊 and passionate about Artificial Intelligence 🔮, especially NLP.


I've cultivated a robust portfolio of projects across both private and public sectors. My expertise extends to financial analysis, advertising, and marketing, where data-driven insights are pivotal to strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.

In the public sphere, my analytical skills contribute to the development of policies that uphold human rights, enhance security, and foster community coexistence. I am deeply engaged with energy policy, armed conflict resolution, and peace-building efforts—striving to create a positive societal impact through data.

Join me in exploring the intersection where data meets policy, and analytics spark change.
